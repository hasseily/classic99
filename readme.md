Gamelink99 is a RESTRICTIVE LICENSE fork of Classic99, the Ti-99 emulator for Windows. The only reason for you to use this fork is if you plan on running Grid Cartographer and mapping a Ti-99 CRPG. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go to the repository of Classic 99 at https://github.com/tursilion/classic99

Classic99 is an open source (but restrictive license) emulator including ROMs licensed by Texas Instruments - see [documentation](https://github.com/tursilion/classic99/raw/master/dist/Classic99%20Manual.pdf) for license and restrictions.
